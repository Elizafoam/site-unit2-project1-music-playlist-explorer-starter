### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

    - Yes, it helped with setting up the modal and getting data from objects. I did not feel unprepared for any aspects of the project minus the stretch features.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
    - If I had more time I would implement more of the stretch features. I would include a filtering option and an option for the user to create playlist and add songs to different playlists. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

    - Everything went well, I would have loved to spend more time explaining different features and the idea behind different parts.
